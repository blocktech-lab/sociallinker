A plugin to add modern, open social media sharing links to your website.

== Description ==

In recent years, social media has evolved, but many websites still use outdated "share to Facebook" or "share to Twitter" links. New platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads lack proper "share to" buttons that encompass the modern social media landscape.

SocialLinker addresses this gap.

Upon activating this plugin, a "share to social media" button will appear at the bottom of each post and page on your site. Clicking this button will direct users to a page with links to various modern social media platforms. Users can select one of the pre-set sites to share the post. Additionally, if a user has a Mastodon instance, a Known site, or an IndieWeb site on a different domain, they can enter that domain, and SocialLinker will attempt to facilitate sharing to that site.
